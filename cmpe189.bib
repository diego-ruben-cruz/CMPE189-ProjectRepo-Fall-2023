  abstract = {Laser Communication is the most evolving arenas in the field of wireless communication. Presently, laser commutation is espoused in the satellite communication for the purpose of space research related activities because of its benefits such as less power consumption, low cost, flexibility and resistance to the radio interferences. This work is an application of laser communication for transmitting data between two ends. Laser Communication needs the transmitter and receiver to be aligned in line-of-sight. The carrier which transmits the signal is produced by a laser diode. The main objective of this work is to transmit audio signal from transmitter to receiver by using the laser beam as a medium. The complete system for this work consists of a transmitter and a reciever capable of transmititng and recieving the analog signal respectively. The results shows that input signal frequencies are preserved at the output with less distortion. However there is decrease in the amplitude of the received signal which can be increased at the output end and the original signal can be recovered. Signal to Noise Ratio is used as a performance metric and it is derived from experimentation that, for higher frequencies Signal to Noise Ratio is more, and for lower frequencies Signal to Noise Ratio is less.},

  abstract = {Wireless networks, including IEEE 802.11-based or Wi-Fi networks, are inexpensive and easy to install and therefore serve as useful connectivity alternatives in areas lacking wired-network infrastructure. However, IEEE 802.11 networks may not always provide the seamless connectivity and minimal throughput required for Industry 4.0 communications because of their susceptibility to interference from other devices operating in the unlicensed "Industrial, Scientific, and Medical" frequency band. Here we analyzed how a wireless audio transmitter operating on this band influences the throughput of an IEEE 802.11 b/g/n network under laboratory conditions. Wireless audio transmission reduced mean throughput by 85\%, rendering the IEEE 802.11 b/g/n network nearly unusable. Our analysis suggests that in order for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks to support Industrial 4.0 applications, attention should be paid to the physical layer as well as the data or upper layers, and critical services should not transmit on the 2.4 GHz band. These findings may contribute to understanding and managing IEEE 802.11 wireless networks in various Industry 4.0 contexts.},

  abstract = {Wireless microphones have been used with cameras for years, as they provide a variety of benefits to the production. A concealed transmitter and mic on the talent grabs his or her words at a distance with usable level and intelligibility, in sync with the video and without the masking of extraneous noise. Sight lines and sets are cleaner. A clear wireless signal can prove more robust than long cable runs with multiple connections that create the possibility of induced hum or other signal degradation. The latest generation of wireless mics has drawn on advances in computing, networking and digital audio processing to offer an even more reliable signal - one with a resolution that melds with high-definition visuals provided by new cameras.},
